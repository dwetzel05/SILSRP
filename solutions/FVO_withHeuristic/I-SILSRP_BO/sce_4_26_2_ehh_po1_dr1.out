Data preprocessing, load /upb/departments/pc2/groups/hpc-prf-winf4/dwetzel/SILSRP/inst_final/sce_4_26_2
and create additional sets and parameters
	|- Read vessel information, number of vessels:	11
	|- Read node information, number of nodes:		610
	|- Read arc information
		|- Number of sailing arcs:			4126
		|- Number of transshipment arcs:	803
	|- Read container information
		|- Number of demands:		2847
		|- Number of empties (+/-):	309/278
	|- Create additional sets and parameters
