Solve scenario sce_4_26_3 with free vessel operation using the expanding horizon heuristic
Vessels can omit ports, Demands can be rejected
####################################################################################################
Data preprocessing, load /upb/departments/pc2/groups/hpc-prf-winf4/dwetzel/SILSRP/inst_final/sce_4_26_3
and create additional sets and parameters
	|- Read vessel information, number of vessels:	6
	|- Read node information, number of nodes:		397
	|- Read arc information
		|- Number of sailing arcs:			1631
		|- Number of transshipment arcs:	578
	|- Read container information
		|- Number of demands:		657
		|- Number of empties (+/-):	158/165
	|- Create additional sets and parameters
