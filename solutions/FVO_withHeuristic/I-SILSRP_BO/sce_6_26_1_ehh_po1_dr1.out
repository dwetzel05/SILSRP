Data preprocessing, load /upb/departments/pc2/groups/hpc-prf-winf4/dwetzel/SILSRP/inst_final/sce_6_26_1
and create additional sets and parameters
	|- Read vessel information, number of vessels:	17
	|- Read node information, number of nodes:		848
	|- Read arc information
		|- Number of sailing arcs:			9152
		|- Number of transshipment arcs:	1583
	|- Read container information
		|- Number of demands:		4505
		|- Number of empties (+/-):	437/371
	|- Create additional sets and parameters
