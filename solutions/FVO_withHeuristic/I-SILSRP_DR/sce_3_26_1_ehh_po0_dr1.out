Data preprocessing, load /upb/departments/pc2/groups/hpc-prf-winf4/dwetzel/SILSRP/inst_final/sce_3_26_1
and create additional sets and parameters
	|- Read vessel information, number of vessels:	5
	|- Read node information, number of nodes:		369
	|- Read arc information
		|- Number of sailing arcs:			1499
		|- Number of transshipment arcs:	497
	|- Read container information
		|- Number of demands:		605
		|- Number of empties (+/-):	152/140
	|- Create additional sets and parameters
