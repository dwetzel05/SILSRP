Solve scenario sce_3_26_2 with free vessel operation using the expanding horizon heuristic
Vessels cannot omit ports, Demands can be rejected
####################################################################################################
Data preprocessing, load /upb/departments/pc2/groups/hpc-prf-winf4/dwetzel/SILSRP/inst_final/sce_3_26_2
and create additional sets and parameters
	|- Read vessel information, number of vessels:	5
	|- Read node information, number of nodes:		292
	|- Read arc information
		|- Number of sailing arcs:			895
		|- Number of transshipment arcs:	428
	|- Read container information
		|- Number of demands:		361
		|- Number of empties (+/-):	97/115
	|- Create additional sets and parameters
