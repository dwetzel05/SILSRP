Data preprocessing, load /upb/departments/pc2/groups/hpc-prf-winf4/dwetzel/SILSRP/inst_final/sce_5_26_1
and create additional sets and parameters
	|- Read vessel information, number of vessels:	10
	|- Read node information, number of nodes:		554
	|- Read arc information
		|- Number of sailing arcs:			3104
		|- Number of transshipment arcs:	977
	|- Read container information
		|- Number of demands:		1239
		|- Number of empties (+/-):	227/251
	|- Create additional sets and parameters
