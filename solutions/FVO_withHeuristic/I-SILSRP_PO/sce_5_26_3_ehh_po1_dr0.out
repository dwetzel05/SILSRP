Data preprocessing, load /upb/departments/pc2/groups/hpc-prf-winf4/dwetzel/SILSRP/inst_final/sce_5_26_3
and create additional sets and parameters
	|- Read vessel information, number of vessels:	12
	|- Read node information, number of nodes:		557
	|- Read arc information
		|- Number of sailing arcs:			3267
		|- Number of transshipment arcs:	1079
	|- Read container information
		|- Number of demands:		1704
		|- Number of empties (+/-):	260/226
